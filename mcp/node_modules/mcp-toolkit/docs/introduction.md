# Introduction to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized communication protocol that enables LLM applications to connect with external data sources, tools, and resources. It defines how LLM applications can:

- Access contextually relevant information
- Execute external tools and functions
- Receive real-time updates to resources
- Interact with prompted content

## Why MCP Matters

LLMs often need access to external context, tools, and resources to provide accurate, personalized, and up-to-date responses. MCP addresses this need by providing a standardized way for LLMs to:

1. **Access External Context**: Retrieve relevant information from databases, knowledge bases, or APIs
2. **Execute External Tools**: Call external functions or services to perform actions
3. **Use Real-Time Data**: Access current data rather than relying on training data
4. **Enhance Capabilities**: Extend the capabilities of LLMs beyond their training data

## Key Concepts

### Servers and Clients

- **MCP Servers**: Expose resources, tools, and prompts that can be accessed by clients
- **MCP Clients**: Connect to servers to access resources, execute tools, and retrieve prompts

### Resources

Resources are content exposed by MCP servers that clients can read. They can be:

- Documents or text content
- Structured data
- Media files
- Database records

Resources are identified by URIs in the format: `mcp://server-name/resource-path`

### Tools

Tools are executable functions exposed by MCP servers that clients can call. They can:

- Perform calculations
- Query databases
- Call external APIs
- Execute business logic

Each tool has defined parameters and a return value schema.

### Prompts

Prompts are reusable templates for LLM interactions that can be shared between applications.

## MCP Architecture

MCP follows a client-server architecture:

```
+----------------+     +----------------+
|                |     |                |
|  LLM           |     | MCP Server     |
|  Application   |<--->| - Resources    |
|  with MCP      |     | - Tools        |
|  Client        |     | - Prompts      |
|                |     |                |
+----------------+     +----------------+
```

### Protocol Layers

1. **Transport Layer**: Handles communication between client and server
   - Stdio for local processes
   - HTTP/SSE for remote connections

2. **Message Layer**: JSON-RPC 2.0 format for structured communication
   - Request/response pattern
   - Notifications for asynchronous events

3. **MCP Layer**: Defines MCP-specific operations
   - Resource operations: list, read, subscribe
   - Tool operations: list, call
   - Prompt operations: list, get

## Getting Started

To start using MCP, you need:

1. An MCP client that can connect to MCP servers
2. Access to one or more MCP servers that provide resources and tools

The MCP Toolkit provides a TypeScript implementation of an MCP client that can connect to any MCP-compliant server.

## Use Cases

- **AI Agents**: Access tools and resources to complete complex tasks
- **Chatbots**: Retrieve up-to-date information to answer user queries
- **Content Generation**: Access reference materials and execute content-processing tools
- **Data Analysis**: Connect to databases and analytical tools
