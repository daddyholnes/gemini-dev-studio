# Podplay Build - Critical Issues & Help Needed

## Current Status
The Podplay Build application is experiencing several critical issues that prevent core functionality from working properly. Despite multiple attempts at fixes, these problems persist and require specialized technical solutions.

## Critical Issues

### 1. WebContainer API Initialization Failure
**Error:** 
```
[ERROR] üõ†Ô∏è Build Mode Error: Failed to initialize Build Mode: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@webcontainer/api@1.1.0/dist/index.js
```

**Details:**
- Build Mode cannot initialize because the WebContainer API fails to load from CDN
- This error occurs consistently across multiple attempts
- Despite implementing a local fallback mechanism, the issue persists
- Build Mode button exists but functionality is completely broken

**Possible Causes:**
- CORS issues preventing the CDN resource from loading
- Network restrictions or firewall blocking access to jsdelivr.net
- Version compatibility issues with WebContainer API
- Incorrect implementation of the fallback mechanism

### 2. UI Layout Issues
**Problem:**
- Chat still occupies only the top half of the screen
- UI layout doesn't adjust properly when new components are added
- New features being added but not visibly rendering

**Details:**
- CSS layout issues not being properly addressed
- Potential DOM manipulation issues where elements are created but not visible
- Possible z-index conflicts or positioning problems

### 3. MCP Dashboard Not Starting Any Servers
**Problem:**
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) features not working
- No servers starting despite configuration attempts
- MCP-dependent features completely non-functional

**Details:**
- This issue has persisted for approximately 24 hours despite multiple fix attempts
- Could be related to server initialization, port conflicts, or configuration issues
- May be connected to other system failures

### 4. Agent System & Model Orchestrator Not Functioning
**Problem:**
- Recently added agent system (Research Hound, Code Weasel) not visible or functional
- Model orchestrator code added but not properly integrating with the chat system
- New features exist in code but don't appear in the UI

**Details:**
- JavaScript may be loading but DOM manipulation failing
- Event listeners potentially not attaching properly
- Possible issues with the timing of initialization

## Requested Research & Solutions

### For WebContainer API Issues:
1. Alternative CDN sources for WebContainer API
2. Complete local implementation of WebContainer API fallbacks
3. Proper CORS configuration for Podplay Build
4. Code examples of successful WebContainer API implementation
5. Debugging techniques to identify exact failure point

### For UI Layout:
1. CSS grid/flexbox solutions for dynamic chat layout
2. JavaScript approaches to properly resize and position the chat window
3. Examples of split-pane layouts with adjustable heights
4. Event-driven UI updates that properly reflow the document

### For MCP Dashboard:
1. Troubleshooting steps for MCP server initialization
2. Common configuration issues with MCP servers
3. Alternative approaches to model integration without MCP
4. Port conflict resolution techniques

### For Agent System:
1. Correct implementation patterns for agent switching UI
2. DOM manipulation best practices for dynamically adding UI elements
3. Debug strategies for invisible but present DOM elements

## Code Snippets Needed
- Working implementation of WebContainer API with fallback
- Functioning model orchestrator integration with chat system
- Proper DOM manipulation for agent UI components
- Event-driven layout management for chat interface

## Priority Fixes
1. WebContainer API loading (highest priority - blocks all Build Mode functionality)
2. Chat layout issues (blocks usability)
3. MCP dashboard functionality (blocks advanced features)
4. Agent system integration (enhances capabilities)

Your assistance with researching these issues and providing working code examples would be incredibly valuable. The Podplay Build project has great potential but is currently hampered by these technical obstacles.

## Environment Information
- Browser: Chrome
- OS: Windows
- WebContainer API version attempted: 1.1.0
- Current implementation repository: https://github.com/daddyholnes/gemini-dev-studio

Thank you for your help in resolving these critical issues!
