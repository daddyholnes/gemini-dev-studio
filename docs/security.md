# Security Considerations

## Overview

Security is a fundamental aspect of your Podplay Build sanctuary. This document outlines the security architecture, potential risks, and best practices for maintaining a secure development environment.

## API Key Management

### Environment Variables

All sensitive information, including API keys, should be stored in environment variables:

1. **The `.env` File**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Never commit this file to version control
   - Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file

   ```
   # Example .env file
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
   BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your-brave-api-key
   SECRET_KEY=your-flask-secret-key
   ```

2. **Loading Environment Variables**:
   - Variables are loaded using Python's `os.environ.get()`
   - The application falls back to defaults if variables are not set
   - Example usage:
     ```python
     api_key = os.environ.get('GEMINI_API_KEY', None)
     if not api_key:
         logger.warning("GEMINI_API_KEY not found in environment variables")
     ```

3. **Never Hardcode Secrets**:
   - API keys should never be hardcoded in source files
   - Secrets should not be logged or exposed in error messages
   - Rotate API keys periodically for enhanced security

## Docker Security

When using Docker MCP services:

1. **Container Isolation**:
   - Each MCP service runs in an isolated container
   - Containers have limited access to the host system
   - Use non-root users inside containers when possible

2. **Image Security**:
   - Use official or trusted base images
   - Keep images updated with security patches
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities regularly

3. **Resource Limits**:
   - Set memory and CPU limits for containers
   - Monitor container resource usage
   - Prevent container resource exhaustion attacks

4. **Network Security**:
   - Limit exposed ports to only what's necessary
   - Use internal Docker networks when possible
   - Implement proper network segmentation

5. **Volume Security**:
   - Mount only necessary directories
   - Use read-only volumes when possible
   - Avoid mounting sensitive directories

## Code Execution Safety

The Podplay Build sanctuary includes code execution capabilities, which require careful security considerations:

1. **Sandboxed Execution**:
   - Code execution is contained within a sandbox
   - WebAssembly runtime provides isolation
   - Resource limits prevent excessive usage

2. **Permission Controls**:
   - Code execution has limited file system access
   - Network access is restricted
   - System call filtering prevents dangerous operations

3. **Input Validation**:
   - All code input is validated before execution
   - Special characters and potentially malicious patterns are detected
   - Maximum code size and execution time limits are enforced

## File System Security

1. **Path Traversal Prevention**:
   - All file paths are normalized and validated
   - No access is allowed outside the project directory
   - Special characters in paths are properly handled

2. **File Permission Management**:
   - File operations respect system permissions
   - Temporary files are created with appropriate permissions
   - Sensitive files are protected from unauthorized access

3. **File Content Validation**:
   - Binary files are handled safely
   - Text file encodings are properly detected and processed
   - File size limits are enforced to prevent denial of service

## Web Security

1. **CSRF Protection**:
   - Flask's CSRF protection is enabled
   - CSRF tokens are required for state-changing operations
   - Proper origin validation is implemented

2. **Content Security Policy**:
   - Restrictive CSP headers are set
   - Inline scripts are minimized
   - External resources are limited to trusted sources

3. **XSS Prevention**:
   - All user inputs are sanitized
   - HTML content is escaped properly
   - JavaScript injection vectors are mitigated

4. **Secure Cookies**:
   - HTTP-only flags are set on sensitive cookies
   - Secure flags are used when HTTPS is available
   - SameSite restrictions are implemented

## WebSocket Security

1. **Connection Validation**:
   - WebSocket connections are authenticated
   - Origin checking prevents cross-site WebSocket hijacking
   - Session validation ensures proper authorization

2. **Message Validation**:
   - All WebSocket messages are validated
   - JSON schema validation prevents malformed data
   - Rate limiting prevents message flooding

3. **Disconnection Handling**:
   - Graceful handling of unexpected disconnections
   - Resource cleanup on connection termination
   - Reconnection logic with exponential backoff

## AI Safety Measures

1. **Prompt Injection Prevention**:
   - User inputs are monitored for prompt injection attempts
   - System prompts are protected from user manipulation
   - Validation of AI outputs before execution

2. **Content Filtering**:
   - Inappropriate content detection
   - Context window sanitization
   - Response filtering for potentially harmful content

3. **Action Confirmation**:
   - Destructive actions require confirmation
   - Critical operations are logged for auditing
   - Safeguards against accidental data loss

## Logging and Monitoring

1. **Security Logging**:
   - All security events are logged
   - Authentication attempts are recorded
   - Suspicious activities trigger alerts

2. **Log Protection**:
   - Logs are protected from tampering
   - Sensitive information is redacted from logs
   - Log rotation prevents disk space exhaustion

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Runtime monitoring for abnormal behavior
   - Resource usage tracking
   - Error rate monitoring for potential attacks

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Containment**:
   - Shut down affected services
   - Isolate compromised components
   - Preserve evidence for investigation

2. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze logs and system state
   - Determine the scope of the incident
   - Identify the root cause

3. **Recovery**:
   - Remove unauthorized access
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore from clean backups if needed

4. **Prevention**:
   - Update security measures
   - Improve detection capabilities
   - Document lessons learned

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep all dependencies updated
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Monitor security advisories for used components

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Grant only necessary permissions
   - Use non-privileged accounts when possible
   - Minimize the attack surface

3. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Implement multiple security layers
   - Don't rely on a single security control
   - Assume breaches will occur and plan accordingly

4. **Security Testing**:
   - Perform regular security reviews
   - Test for common vulnerabilities
   - Conduct penetration testing when feasible
