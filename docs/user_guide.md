## üí¨ Communicating with Mama Bear

### Effective Communication Patterns

Mama Bear works best when you:

1. **Provide Vision and Goals**: Tell her what you want to achieve, not just how to do it
2. **Trust Her Expertise**: Let her implement solutions autonomously
3. **Focus on High-Level Direction**: You handle the "why" and "what," she'll handle the "how"

### Example Conversations

#### ‚úÖ Effective Request
```
I want to create a simple React app that fetches data from an API and displays it in a table. 
The table should be sortable and filterable. Let's make it look clean and modern.
```

#### ‚ùå Too Micromanaging
```
Create a new React component called DataTable.js. Inside it, write a functional component that 
uses useState and useEffect hooks. Add a fetch call to get data from the API endpoint. Then 
style it with CSS. Make sure to add error handling.
```

### Conversation Commands

While chatting with Mama Bear, you can use special commands:

- `/help` - Display help information
- `/clear` - Clear the current chat
- `/reset` - Reset Mama Bear's context
- `/mcp <tool>` - Use a specific MCP tool
